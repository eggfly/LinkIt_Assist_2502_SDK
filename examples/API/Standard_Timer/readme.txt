This example demonstrates how to create precise, non-precise and hisr timer. Furthermore it shows how to compute the precise timers every period, and how to delete them.

This example creates a precise timer(vm_timer_create_precise) and then creates a non-precise timer(vm_timer_create_non_precise). In the end it creates a hisr timer(vm_timer_create_hisr and vm_timer_set_hisr).
